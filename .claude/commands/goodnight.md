# Goodnight - End-of-Day Status Report

You are running the user's end-of-day operational close-out. This is a technical/PM-focused review - think engineering standup for yourself, not therapy session.

## Philosophy

The goal is clean handoff to tomorrow-you:
- **Inventory** - what's the state of everything?
- **Accountability** - what got done?
- **Queue** - what's the priority sequence for tomorrow?
- **Context** - what would tomorrow-you need to know to hit the ground running?

This is the complement to `/morning` - morning surfaces the landscape, goodnight closes the books.

## Instructions

### 1. Check current date/time

```bash
date +"%A, %d %b %Y"  # friendly display
date +"%Y-%m-%d"       # for file paths
date +"%I:%M%P" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'  # for session timestamp
```

### 2. Gather Today's Activity (auto)

Read and compile:
- **Today's sessions:** Check `06 Archive/Claude Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for today's date
- **Works in Progress:** Read `01 Now/Works in Progress.md` for project states
- **Completed tasks:** Extract from session summaries
- **Candidate open loops:** Extract all unchecked items (`- [ ]`) from session files

**Important:** Store this data in working memory - it's a DRAFT inventory, not ground truth.

### 3. Pre-Verification Debrief (BEFORE presenting report)

**This step happens BEFORE displaying any open loops.** The goal is to update your working model with reality before presenting outdated information.

Ask:
> "Before I show today's report, let me check: did you complete anything outside Claude today? Any tasks from earlier sessions that are now done?"

Wait for response.

**If the user provides completions:**
1. Update your working memory (mark those items as completed in your draft)
2. **Update session files immediately** (see Step 3a)
3. Then proceed to Step 4 with the corrected data

**If the user says "no" or "nothing":** Proceed to Step 4 with original data.

### 3a. Update Session Files for Completed Loops

When the user reports a loop is complete, update the source session file:

1. **Locate the specific session** containing the loop (you have this from Step 2)
2. **Use flock for safe editing:**
   ```bash
   flock -w 10 "06 Archive/Claude Sessions/.lock" -c "
     sed -i 's/^- \\[ \\] EXACT_LOOP_TEXT$/- [x] EXACT_LOOP_TEXT/' '06 Archive/Claude Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md'
   "
   ```
3. **Confirm the update:** Display brief acknowledgement:
   ```
   ✓ Marked complete: "LOOP_TEXT" (in Session N)
   ```

**Why update immediately:** Prevents the same loop from appearing as open in future `/goodnight`, `/pickup`, or `/weekly-synthesis` runs.

### 4. Present Status Report

**Now** display the report using your corrected working memory:

```
## Today's Report - [Day, Date]

**Sessions:** N
**Projects touched:** [list]

### Completed
- [x] Task 1 (session)
- [x] Task 2 (session)
- [x] Task 3 (marked done just now)

### Open Loops (by project)
**[Project A]**
- [ ] Loop 1
- [ ] Loop 2

**[Project B]**
- [ ] Loop 1

**Unassigned**
- [ ] Orphan loop
```

**Note:** The "(marked done just now)" annotation helps the user see what was just reconciled vs what was already recorded.

### 4a. Mid-Flow Corrections

**If the user corrects you during the report** ("actually that's done", "I finished that earlier"):

1. **Acknowledge immediately:** "Got it, marking that complete."
2. **Update session file** (same process as Step 3a)
3. **Update your working memory** - do NOT re-read session files (you'll get stale data)
4. **Continue with corrected state** - don't re-display the whole report

**Critical:** Once the user tells you something is done, treat it as done for the rest of this session. Do not pull from files again.

### 4b. Additional Captures (brief, optional)

Ask:
> "Anything else not captured? New blockers, decisions made, or items to add?"

- If yes: add to inventory (but don't add to session files - these go in the daily report)
- If no: proceed

### 5. Set Tomorrow's Queue

Ask:
> "What's the priority order for tomorrow?"

Help structure as:

```
### Tomorrow's Queue
1. **[Must-do]** - [why it's priority]
2. **[Should-do]** - [context]
3. **[If time]** - [nice to have]

**Blockers/Dependencies:**
- [Anything waiting on external input]
```

If the user doesn't have strong opinions, suggest based on:
- Time-sensitive items first
- Blocked items need unblocking
- High-momentum items worth continuing

### 6. Generate Daily Report

Create file at `06 Archive/Daily Reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# Daily Report - [Day], [Date]

## Sessions
- Session 1: [Topic] - [outcome]
- Session 2: [Topic] - [outcome]

## Completed
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Task 2

## Open Loops

### [Project A]
- [ ] Loop 1
- [ ] Loop 2

### [Project B]
- [ ] Loop 1

### Unassigned
- [ ] Orphan loop

## Tomorrow's Queue
1. **[Priority 1]** - [why]
2. **[Priority 2]** - [context]
3. **[Priority 3]** - [if time]

## Blockers
- [Item] - waiting on [what]

## Notes
[Any context tomorrow-you needs]

---
*Links:*
- Sessions: [[06 Archive/Claude Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD]]
- Previous: [[06 Archive/Daily Reports/YYYY-MM-DD]] (yesterday if exists)
```

Ensure directory exists first:
```bash
mkdir -p "06 Archive/Daily Reports"
```

### 7. Log Goodnight Session with Bidirectional Links

Append a session entry for the goodnight session itself to today's session file.

#### 7a. Find Previous Session and Determine Next Session Number

1. Read today's session file to find the last session number
2. New session number = last + 1
3. Store previous session's heading for forward linking

#### 7b. Add Forward Link to Previous Session (with guards)

**GUARD 1 - Idempotency check:**
```bash
# Check if forward link already exists
if grep -q "\\*\\*Next session:\\*\\*.*#Session $NEW_NUM - Goodnight" "$SESSION_FILE"; then
  echo "Forward link already exists, skipping"
  # Skip insertion
fi
```

**GUARD 2 - Scoped insertion (find previous session's block):**
```bash
# Find previous session heading line number
PREV_HEADING=$(grep -n "^## Session $PREV_NUM - " "$SESSION_FILE" | tail -1 | cut -d: -f1)

# Find next session heading (or EOF)
NEXT_HEADING=$(tail -n +$((PREV_HEADING + 1)) "$SESSION_FILE" | grep -n "^## Session " | head -1 | cut -d: -f1)
if [ -n "$NEXT_HEADING" ]; then
  END_LINE=$((PREV_HEADING + NEXT_HEADING - 1))
else
  END_LINE=$(wc -l < "$SESSION_FILE")
fi

# Find insertion point (after last metadata line in previous session)
# For Full sessions: after Project/Continues/Previous session lines
# For Quick sessions [Q]: after the content line (typically line after heading)
INSERT_AFTER=$(sed -n "${PREV_HEADING},${END_LINE}p" "$SESSION_FILE" | \
  grep -n "^\\*\\*\\(Project\\|Continues\\|Previous session\\):\\*\\*" | tail -1 | cut -d: -f1)

# Fallback for Quick sessions (no metadata lines)
if [ -z "$INSERT_AFTER" ]; then
  # Insert after first non-empty line in the session block
  INSERT_AFTER=$(sed -n "${PREV_HEADING},${END_LINE}p" "$SESSION_FILE" | \
    grep -n "." | tail -1 | cut -d: -f1)
fi

INSERT_LINE=$((PREV_HEADING + INSERT_AFTER - 1))

# Insert with flock
flock -w 10 "06 Archive/Claude Sessions/.lock" -c "
  sed -i \"${INSERT_LINE}a\\**Next session:** [[06 Archive/Claude Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD#Session N - Goodnight: Topic]]\" \"$SESSION_FILE\"
"
```

**GUARD 3 - Post-insertion validation:**
```bash
NEXT_COUNT=$(sed -n "${PREV_HEADING},${END_LINE}p" "$SESSION_FILE" | grep -c "^\\*\\*Next session:\\*\\*")
if [ "$NEXT_COUNT" -gt 1 ]; then
  echo "⚠ WARNING: Previous session has $NEXT_COUNT 'Next session:' links - manual review needed"
fi
```

#### 7c. Append Goodnight Session Entry

Use flock for concurrent safety:

```bash
flock -w 10 "06 Archive/Claude Sessions/.lock" -c 'cat >> "06 Archive/Claude Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md" << '\''EOF'\''

## Session N - Goodnight: [Brief Topic Summary] (HH:MMam/pm)

### Summary
[2-3 sentences covering what was reviewed/decided/updated during goodnight]

### Key Insights / Decisions
- [Any significant decisions made during close-out]

### Next Steps / Open Loops
- [ ] [Remaining items for tomorrow]

### Files Updated
- [List any files modified during goodnight]

### Pickup Context
**For next session:** [One sentence for tomorrow morning]
**Previous session:** [[06 Archive/Claude Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD#Session N-1 - Previous Title]]
EOF'
```

**Critical:** Always add the "Next session" link to the previous session BEFORE appending the new session. This maintains bidirectional linking.

### 8. Update Works in Progress

If any project status changed significantly today, update `01 Now/Works in Progress.md` with current state.

### 9. Close

```
✓ Report saved: 06 Archive/Daily Reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md
✓ Session logged: 06 Archive/Claude Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md (Session N)
✓ Open loops: N items across M projects
✓ Tomorrow's #1: [Priority item]

Goodnight.
```

## Guidelines

- **Technical, not emotional:** Focus on state and status, not feelings
- **Accountability:** The completed list matters - own what got done
- **Forward-looking:** Tomorrow's queue is the point - set yourself up
- **Quick:** This should take 3-5 minutes unless there's a lot to capture
- **No guilt:** If it was a low-output day, just note the status honestly
- **File locking is mandatory:** Use `flock` via Bash for session file writes. Lock file: `06 Archive/Claude Sessions/.lock`
- **Scoped forward linking:** When adding "Next session:" links, always scope to specific session block. Never use global patterns that match all sessions.

### Working Memory Model (Critical)

**Session files are inputs, not ground truth.** Once you read them in Step 2, work from your working memory for the rest of the command. This prevents the bug where:
1. the user says "that's done"
2. You acknowledge it
3. You re-read the session file (which still shows it open)
4. You present it as open again

**The flow:**
1. Read session files once (Step 2) - populate working memory
2. Ask about completions BEFORE presenting (Step 3) - update working memory AND files
3. Present from working memory (Step 4) - never re-read files mid-flow
4. Handle mid-flow corrections (Step 4a) - update working memory AND files
5. Generate daily report from working memory (Step 6)

**Session file updates are write-only after initial read.** You update them when the user marks something done (so future runs see correct state), but you don't re-read them within this session.

## Triggers

This command should trigger when the user says:
- "goodnight"
- "end of day"
- "close out"
- "wrap up the day"
- "done for the day"

## Integration

- **Reads from:** Claude Sessions (today), Works in Progress
- **Creates:** Daily Reports
- **Updates:** Claude Sessions (marks loops complete, adds goodnight session with bidirectional links), Works in Progress (if needed)
- **Complements:** `/morning` (start of day), `/park` (end of session), `/regroup` (mid-day)
- **Replaces:** `/daily-review` (deprecated)
