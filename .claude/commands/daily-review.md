# Daily Review (Deprecated)

**This command has been merged into `/goodnight`.**

`/daily-review` was focused on emotional/reflective end-of-day processing. `/goodnight` is the replacement - a more technical/PM-focused end-of-day close-out that inventories loops, sets tomorrow's queue, and creates a clean handoff.

## Action

Inform the user:

```
/daily-review has been deprecated and merged into /goodnight.

Running /goodnight instead...
```

Then run the full `/goodnight` workflow as documented in the goodnight.md command file.
